# CG CV Project

This is the second project I made in the bootcamp

I used the framework provided by my tech coach to extend my last project

I used PHP and MySQL and incorporated the CRUD actions

I also created permissions and an admin side, so if you log in as an admin you can do more than a simple user can

## Installation
- Go to your terminal
- composer install
- npm install
- create a MySQL database and remember username, database name and password to save in .env file
- save .env.example as .env
- enter your MySQL credentials in your .env file

## Database Migration
- go to your project folder in the terminal
- type: php migrate.php -f -s (-f rewrites all tables, -s seeds the tables)
